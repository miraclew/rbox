/*!
 A MP Framework Installation Object that is a local representation of an
 installation persisted to the MP cloud. This class is a subclass of a
 MPObject, and retains the same functionality of a MPObject, but also extends
 it with installation-specific fields and related immutability and validity
 checks.
 
 A valid MPInstallation can only be instantiated via
 [MPInstallation currentInstallation] because the required identifier fields
 are readonly. The timeZone and badge fields are also readonly properties which
 are automatically updated to match the device's time zone and application badge
 when the MPInstallation is saved, thus these fields might not reflect the
 latest device state if the installation has not recently been saved.
 
 MPInstallation objects which have a valid deviceToken and are saved to
 the MP cloud can be used to target push notifications.
 
 This class is currently for iOS only. There is no MPInstallation for MP
 applications running on OS X, because they cannot receive push notifications.
